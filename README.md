# Vehicle Speed Calculation using YOLOV and StrongSORT

This project focuses on creating a model for estimating vehicle speeds based on video footage. The YOLOV model is employed to detect vehicles, while StrongSORT is used for vehicle tracking. The speed calculation is carried out using the formula v = s/t, where v represents velocity, s denotes distance, and t stands for time.
